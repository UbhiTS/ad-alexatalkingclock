## New Features and Updates - v3.0
### User Defined Reminders
Let Alexa be your personal assistant and give you personal reminders. Reminder Schedule can be Daily, Weekdays, Weekends, or Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun
### Local Language
Time Alerts and Reminders in your Local Language
### Sonos Support
Set bell:false and remove the voice effects section (kudos to @5and0)
### Whisper, Pitch, Volume, Rate and Bell Controls
Set "Bell" to False and "Rate" to 50 for a creepy announcement. Awesome for Halloween, or just to scare someone!
### Multiple Speakers
Target multiple speakers in your home with one app

NOTE: :boom:**Please update your apps.yaml with the new configuration structure**:boom:

Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Sonos (or other smart speakers) will keep on reminding you of the time from morning till night and also courteously greet with a good morning, good afternoon, and a good night & sweet dreams all without you having to lift a finger (or speak a word). Sweet!

## Thank you for your time! (get it ;) :raised_hands:
This app was a result of my amazing wife's request (who is a mother of 2 beautiful princesses BTW) to help her manage her time wisely ;). So this is dedicated to my wife Reena, without whom this world would not be worth my time :) 

This also wouldn't be possible without the amazing work done by the developers and community at **[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)**

A very special thanks to **Keaton Taylor** and **Alan Tse** whose work on **[Alexa Media Player](https://github.com/custom-components/alexa_media_player)** was the basis of my inspiration and my work to code all the above listed apps!

Ever since we've set this up in our home, it has become an indispensable part of our lives. It's amazing to see how a simple reminder of the current time in the day can make people more efficient :), I hope this app helps others as it has helped us. 

If you like my work and feel gracious, you can buy me a beer below ;)
